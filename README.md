# cloudsync

**This project is obsolete and inactive. I recommend to use [rclone](https://rclone.org/) as a much more powerful alternative. If you are interested to takeover the ownership. Feel free to contact me.**

Sync a local filesystem on linux, windows and osx incremental and encrypted with google drive simliar to rsync. You can also restore the encrypted data back to a local filesystem. It works as a complete backup solution for your private data.

Other compareable backup solutions like [duplicity](http://duplicity.nongnu.org) upload one big encrypted 'base' archive with additional delta archive files. After a few months you must upload a new fresh 'base' archive to avoid hundreds of delta files. This approach, while widely used in various backup solutions, is problematic for private async DSL connections. To solve these issues each file is encrypted and uploaded separately.

To get a first impression you should take a look at [this screenshot](https://github.com/HolgerHees/cloudsync/wiki/Home).

The encryption is based on OpenPGP with AES 256 (optional) and a passphrase. It is possible to decrypt uploaded files with a normal OpenPGP compatible tool like 'gpg' or 'gpg2'.

Encrypted data includes:
- filetype [folder,file,symlink]
- filecontent, filename and original filesize
- createtime, modifytime and accesstime
- owner, group, posix permissions, acl entries and fat32 attributes
- md5 checksum

Filechanges are detected by comparing the file metadata. It uses a local cachefile to speedup the incremental update. The local cachefile is completly restoreable by analysing the serverside archived metadata.

Supported Services are:
- Google Drive (stable)
- Remote mounted filesystem (beta)
- Dropbox (alpha preview)

To provide additional cloud targets like Amazon Cloud Drive or Microsoft OneDrive just implement 6 functions from the interface [Connector.java](https://github.com/HolgerHees/cloudsync/tree/master/src/main/java/cloudsync/connector/RemoteConnector.java).

## Requirements

1. Java >= 7
2. [Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html) (optional to support AES256)
3. [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HolgerHees/cloudsync.git
cd cloudsync
mvn install
```

## Config

To use, copy ```'config/cloudsync.config.default'``` to ```'config/cloudsync.config'``` and set the following;

- `PASSPHRASE`: your master password used for encrypt/decrypt

There are two authentication options, either using an Installed Application or Service Account.

Both options require that you [enable the Google Drive API](https://github.com/HolgerHees/cloudsync/wiki/Google-Drive-API). 

### Installed Application

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/HolgerHees/cloudsync/wiki/Google-Client-Credentials) to set the following;

- `GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET`

### Service Account

This process requires more configuration however will ensure you can run unattended.

1. [Create Service Account](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount). You must ensure that you [delegate domain-wide authority to your service account](https://developers.google.com/drive/web/delegation#delegate_domain-wide_authority_to_your_service_account).
2. Download P12 keyfile.
3. Set the following in the configuration file.

- `GOOGLE_DRIVE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` - ie.. `<some-id>@developer.gserviceaccount.com`.
- `GOOGLE_DRIVE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_USER` - The Google Drive user, ie.. `you@yourdomain.com`.
- `GOOGLE_DRIVE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY_P12_PATH` - The full or relative path to your P12 file.

## Usage

To create a backup of '/data', call:

```./cloudsync --backup /data --name dataBackup```

to restore a backup into '/restore', call:

```./cloudsync --restore /restore --name dataBackup```
